# CIS-18_NetworkScan Idea 2
Idea 2. This version will be built using a few technologies. My idea for this is to use Ionic for the front end, and asnible on the backend server to execute remote nmap commands and access and store user data, with the exception of auth tokens, which will be stored in the local keychain and keystores on ios and android respectivly, in a basic database built on MariaDB. We will need to develop a RESTful API for the backend to authenticate ansible requests to the server. I like this idea but it does have a few issues, mainly that we will be releying on a remote scan, which limits the ability to scan the local subnet.
